       "{'abstract': 'AbstractThis chapter examines the relationship of climate change, health, and gender in the Pacific region; identifies gaps in research, capacity, and support; and proposes a framework illustrating the practical adaptation measures to be applied in strengthening the Papua New Guinea’s (PNG) public health sector capacity and policy. Using literature review as the research method, the study found that although other countries in the pacific are mostly affected by the climate change impacts, PNG remains highly affected by the climate-induced health impacts. Hence, a case study on Papua New Guinea was prepared. The chapter provides a practical understanding and knowledge on emerging health threats, gender issues, and adaptation measures to strengthen the Pacific and PNG’s public health system. The framework presented in this chapter could be highly beneficial not only for PNG but also for the whole Pacific region.',\n",

Furthermore, most professionals working in contexts in which chronic care is provided, value inter-collegial respect and appreciation of supervisors. Therefore, success and failure factors of implementation of technology in health-care situations are associated with the disruption or support of these values. Mostly, health-care professionals do not themselves think about technological solutions for clinical problems, and therefore, they need support in relating technological solutions to care recipients’ needs. In this chapter, a short overview of professional values is given. Next, we outline how technology can be seen as disrupting professional values but also how it can be supportive of professional values, sometimes unexpected, as practice examples show. The chapter is concluded by consequences for daily practice and education in health-care professions.',\n",

       "  {'abstract': 'AbstractInulin-type fructans are prebiotic dietary fibers, naturally occurring in numerous plants. The chicory root with its high content of inulin-type fructans is the most common basis for gaining inulin from the plant. The process applied is a hot water extraction. This means, contrary to a number of commercially available dietary fibers, inulin is not synthesized but occurs naturally and was eaten by mankind 100,000 years ago. The colon, the main place of action of inulin-type fructans, is a highly active metabolic organ, containing an excessively complex collection of microbes. Inulin-type fructans are nondigestible in the small intestine and fermented in the large intestine, resulting in modifications in the colonic microbiota composition, towards a healthier pattern, and in the production of several metabolites. Thereby, they are among the very few scientifically proven prebiotics. Several health effects are related to this activity in the colon. They may range from local effects, starting with improvement of bowel movement, effects related to local immunity, to more systemic benefits for the body, as a result of the metabolic events, like weight and blood sugar management and bone health. This book chapter aims at providing a comprehensive review of the physiology related to inulin-type fructans and the health benefits related to this. Current developments in understanding the role of the microbiota in health and disease will probably also further contribute to understanding these complex influences originating from the gut and the role “colonic nutrients” such as prebiotic dietary fibers may play therein.',\n",

Since 1840, life expectancy in the world has increased by an extra 3 months per year, a linear trend that has not reached its maximum. This trend is seen worldwide: both the increasing proportion of older people and the individual increase in duration are offering us several challenges and opportunities. Aging, especially the years of very old age, poses key questions as to how to manage health care, well-being, social engagement, dependency, and disability. In many developed countries, there has been a tremendous rise in health-care costs, unfavorably influenced by this trend of aging.Technology can support opportunities and challenges resulting from this trend: with the help of technology, social connectedness can be preserved and also resources, skills, and health-care needs can be supplied.In this chapter, an overview of recent demographic (and other) trends and the underlying causes of these trends and their relationship with accompanying technological developments is given.',\n",

The goal of TigerPlace was to develop a true aging in place housing site in which residents move into independent apartments and stay through the end of life. In-home sensing technology is used to augment care coordination to detect early signs of illness and functional decline to allow early interventions aimed at proactively keeping residents healthy. Over 55 apartments have been outfitted with in-home sensor networks since 2005 with an average longevity of 2.6 years. Sensors tested in TigerPlace apartments include motion sensors, bed sensors, stove temperature sensors, and gait/fall detection sensors. All sensors are environmentally mounted and designed to be as invisible as possible. Studies have investigated which sensors and sensor features are most important for detecting early illness signs. A prospective research study at TigerPlace using in-home sensing and automated health alerts showed significant differences in health outcomes between a control group receiving normal care and an intervention group with sensors and automated health alerts.',\n",

However, the difficulty in determining the magnitude and impacts of climate change has led to challenges in policy-making. This chapter seeks to create a comprehensive understanding of how Colombia and the federal government have made important advances in implementing a climate change framework with a focus on health.This chapter will provide context on the role and responsibilities of the government before discussing the climatic conditions of Colombia and how climate change is impacting the country, especially on the health sector. Such discussion will justify why climate change is a major current and future priority for the country. The chapter will then examine the existing climate change policy framework and ongoing projects that are targeted toward climate and health. This chapter will show that there is still a need to improve the capacities and interest of the public health research community by improving the evidence and knowledge about climate change impacts, vulnerability, and risk. Understanding Colombia’s national circumstances will allow other countries and decision-makers to potentially use Colombia as an example to define their own health and climate change agendas.',\n",

Cliometricians debate the extent to which this “health transition” was the result of nutritional improvements or other factors, such as the increase in public health infrastructure that followed mastery of the germ theory of disease. Although the long-run trend in health was positive, in the nineteenth century, many Western countries experienced cyclical downturns in the biological standard of living, the so-called antebellum puzzle. While the long-run trends in the growth of real GDP, income, and wages were positive, as the presence of the antebellum puzzle suggests, the onset of industrialization was accompanied by an increase in inequality, the stagnation of the expectation of life at birth, increases in morbidity, declines in mean adult stature, and an erosion in the consumption of net nutrients. Taken together, this experience has been labeled the “Malthusian squeeze.”',\n",

Moreover, the occurrence and chemical composition of native dietary fiber such as resistant starch, pectin, hemicelluloses, ß-glucan, and fructan in context to their properties – in particular the prebiotic potential for human health – will be discussed. Important industrially produced bioactive carbohydrates from plant and seaweed sources with high prebiotic efficacy and increasing economic interest such as fructan – particularly inulin and fructooligosaccharides (FOS), heteropolysaccharides, xylooligosaccharides (XOS), and isomaltooligosaccharides (IMO) – will be presented.

The flow of these skills is forthcoming when the return to investment exceeds the cost (both direct and indirect). Returns to these skills are private in the sense that an individual’s productive capacity increases with more of them. But there are often externalities that increase the productive capacity of others when human capital is increased. This essay discusses these concepts historically and focuses on two major components of human capital: education and training, and health. The institutions that encourage human capital investment are discussed, as is the role of human capital in economic growth. The notion that the study of human capital is inherently historical is emphasized and defended.',\n",

Currently, a strong emphasis is being placed on the assessment of the costs associated with the health gains (expressed in quality-adjusted life years) that are achieved with these technologies. Following Hannah Arendt, we shall try to argue that such instrumental rationality is misplaced in discovering how technology can help to express human values. It typically reflects a society where processes of design and development, evaluation, and decision making involve separate trajectories and operate distinct from the realm of the lives of humans. We will present an alternative which is deliberative and transformative in nature. Its strengths and limitations will be explored, using the cochlear implant for deaf children as an example.',\n",

The application of smart environments in the field of health care and assisted living is accelerating at a high pace. These systems can provide cost-effective solutions that will improve the quality of life of humans, particularly those regarded as senior citizens or have some form of disability. The realization of smart environments with real-time monitoring will enable such people to lead independent lives in the comfort of their normal homes. This chapter focuses on highlighting the major components and systems that are currently available to deliver reliable technological solutions for smart homes, health care, and well-being. The key sensing devices that form the basis of smart environments are discussed. The integration of these devices into wireless sensor networks (WSNs) that can be spread over an area to build smart health and assisted living environments is investigated. The role of power line communication technologies, which complements wireless communications, and the new reliable solutions is also highlighted. Wireless communication technologies and the various options and standards available are discussed. Target localization plays a key role in many of the services supported by smart environments. The various fundamental localization techniques are investigated. The major security and privacy issues related to WSNs and wearable body area networks (WBANs) and their impact on the trust in using such systems are addressed. A case study that demonstrates the integration of various WSNs elements to deploy a guiding system for blind persons is described.',\n",

       "  {'abstract': 'AbstractAn introduction and overview is provided of the radiation health challenges associated with extended human missions into deep space with the understanding that this is a complex endeavor presently under active research and development. Hence, this chapter necessarily reflects present limitations and the need for research to make such exploration missions possible. An introduction to the space radiation environment is provided followed by a brief overview of the radiobiology. The remainder of the chapter is focused on human health concerns from radiation exposure during extended deep space missions. Although the challenges are many, the greatest radiation-related concern from a mission perspective would be an exceptionally large solar-energetic-particle (SEP) event. Such an event, should it occur during extravehicular activity (EVA), or while in a spaceship insufficiently shielded, could potentially result in acute radiation sickness. Fortunately, radiation from SEP events can be shielded and therefore should be manageable through a combination of shielding design and early warning systems. In contrast, the ever-present chronic exposure to galactic cosmic radiation (GCR) is difficult to shield and will likely have to be accepted at some level. Although GCR produces a much lower dose rate than a large SEP event, there are significant uncertainties concerning the effects from the high-charge, high-energy (HZE) component of GCR. It has been estimated that GCR radiation may induce a significant lifetime cancer risk. It is less clear whether health effects such as cardiovascular or central nervous system problems will result from protracted GCR exposure. It is hoped that these and many other uncertainties will be reduced through research and development prior to sending humans to Mars.',\n",

       "  {'abstract': 'AbstractThis article concerns the preventive effects of medical liability. On theoretical grounds it is argued that medical liability does not necessarily lead to a socially optimal level of precaution, because the incentives are distorted in various ways. Since the 1970’s US states have enacted a variety of reforms in their tort systems. This variation has provided highly useful data for empirical studies of medical liability issues. For one thing, it has become clear that only some 2% of the patients with negligent injuries gets compensation. The empirical evidence nevertheless suggests that medical liability pressure does affect the behavior of health care providers to some degree. It has a negative effect on the supply of services, and it encourages the ordering of extra diagnostic tests. At the margin, medical liability law does seem to have some social benefits that offset reasonable estimates of overhead and defensive medicine costs.',\n",

       "  {'abstract': 'AbstractGiven the increased life expectancy and considering shortcomings in the care sector, it is a fundamental challenge how older and frail people can be empowered to stay in their private home, keeping up mobility and independency for a longer time. The maturity of information and communication technology on the one hand and of medical technology on the other basically allows technology to take over the monitoring and care. However, so far, the inclusion of human factors and technology acceptance into a successful technology design is not adequately met. In the following, we describe relevant facets of technology empowerment and stigmas and the need to rethink traditional concepts. First, the requirements of adequate use and design of information and communication technologies in the medical field are addressed. Second, as the prevailing image of age is no longer adequate to the current demographic change, the need to rethink age and aging is described. Finally the need of user-centered design is discussed, followed by the need of a rethinking of the technology design process and the inclusion of potential users. The chapter ends with a discussion focused on requirements of patient empowerment to reflect all the aforementioned aspects from a patient’s point of view.',\n",

       "  {'abstract': 'AbstractThis book chapter reviews current research in the area of digital game technology for rehabilitation, socialization, quality of life (QoL), design, and cognition. In recent years, there has been substantial progress in these areas. With technology advancement, there is the potential to facilitate aging in place, resulting in the continuation and maintenance of independent community-based living at varying stages of the life course. As technological developments improve, the concept of integrating digital game technology into the lives of an aging population is becoming more popular than ever before. However, during the implementation into the home, issues of physical space and technology integration may occur. There are many types of dwellings (apartments, houses, or bungalows) where older adults reside which contain a variety of fixtures and furnishings. Implementation of technology into these different dwellings may be difficult due to the added furniture already installed. This chapter initiates discussion within these areas and provides recommendations for future technology integration.',\n",

       "  {'abstract': 'AbstractAdaptation to climate change is increasingly supported through international financing. In contrast to mitigation, where the effectiveness of policy action can be measured through the metric “tonnes of CO2 equivalent reduced,” no universally accepted metric for assessment of adaptation effectiveness exists. Without such a metric, adaptation finance vehicles such as the Adaptation Fund or the Green Climate Fund encounter challenges when trying to compare the adaptive effect of projects in order to achieve an efficient allocation of their funds. First experiences with adaptation funding show a tendency to avoid final impact metrics. This might lead to a backlash against adaptation funding by electorates in industrialized countries if adaptation funding cannot show clear results. This report assesses two possible candidates for generic adaptation effectiveness metrics: (1) wealth saved from climate change impacts and (2) disability-adjusted life years saved (DALYs), which are widely used in public health policy analysis. Apart it is proposed to use no-harm assessments to evaluate environmental and cultural impacts of adaptation projects. The authors discuss uncertainties encountered in applying these metrics, including the uncertain link between commonly reported intermediate indicators and our metrics and ideas to handle such, e.g., the use of regularly updated methodologies and agreed climate and economic models.',\n",

The promise of this technology is focused on providing high-quality data to caregivers. While the research community has published many successes gathering and modeling medical data, there is little work on how to effectively deliver data to caregivers. This study attempts to inform researchers and engineers building smart technologies how to better understand the needs of nurses assisting the elderly. Interviews suggest nutrition, sleep length and quality, cleanliness of the individual, safety, and elopement by cognitively impaired individuals are of central concern. It is also important for programmers to make graphs and charts with axis have a real-world relationship. Sensor “events” are not relevant to nursing staff, and should not be presented in their raw form. Time increments are more appropriate for this population than quantity of sensor events. During the design of user-facing tools, a little extra care to the needs of caregivers can ensure assistive smart homes are helpful technologies.',\n",

For both its potential health benefits and functional properties, resistant starch has received much attention. It can positively influence the functioning of the digestive tract, the microbial flora, the blood cholesterol level, glycemic index and assist in the control of diabetes. Apart from the potential health benefits of resistant starch, another positive advantage is its lower impact on the sensory properties of food compared with traditional sources of fiber, as whole grains, bran, or other prebiotics. The low water-holding capacity, increased viscosity and gel formation and high water-binding capacity make it useful in a variety of foods. In this chapter, it was intended to discuss about different resistant starch types, food sources, potential health benefits and food applications of resistant starch.',\n",

This chapter explores the current status and lessons learned from smart home design and development worldwide to assess what designers and researchers perceive as facilitators and barriers to smart home adoption. A cross-sectional anonymous web survey assessing goals of projects, target audiences, team expertise, and barriers to translation to practice was conducted of smart home project or facility administrators and researchers identified through systematic search of scientific literature and online material. Response rate was 36.7 %. Fifteen usable surveys were included in the analysis. Findings indicate that several smart home projects exist with the aim of supporting communication and independent living. However, there are many challenges to their incorporation into the real world, including lack of funding support beyond the research phase, technology issues, and difficulty gaining widespread recognition as a valuable tool. Proper planning and design strategies are necessary to ensure the success and translation of such projects.',\n",

       "  {'abstract': 'AbstractThe application of domotics in what is often referred to as “smart homes” has encountered an odd obstacle. Many people agree that domotics are a highly promising development. They make life easier, can help the elderly continue living at home for a longer period of time, and can reduce the involvement of professional care providers and case managers, causing healthcare costs to go down. You’d expect to see massive growth in domotics applications. However, that is not the case as of yet, particularly not in extramural healthcare in the Netherlands (Nivel 2011). Applications in intramural institutions regularly involve infrared sensors, noise-level sensors, bed mats, door locks, cameras, speaker-microphone systems, alarm buttons, and chips in clothing. Figures on the amount of extramural application of domotics do not appear to be available in the Netherlands. Applications in the extramural setting appear to primarily involve the personal alarm button (RIVM National Institute for Public Health and the Environment 2013).',\n",

       "  {'abstract': 'AbstractDespite the wide availability of telecare devices, the economic pressures, and the claimed benefits, the uptake of telecare services by older people is disappointingly limited. Much research is spent on finding out why the telecare acceptance is so much less than expected.Ease of use, or rather lack of it – a seemingly likely cause – is difficult to assess since the traditional usability criteria do not apply well to the daily life of older people. Acceptance in the social environment plays an important role, sometimes in a positive sense, but mostly in a negative one; however, social environment is all but impossible to manipulate.What does delay acceptance is the lack of standardization, which, in turn is also due to the fact that the impressive technological progress of the past decades has largely bypassed the field of assistive technology and health care. Another negative factor is cost. Though the price of devices has come down appreciably in recent years, system architecture and installation are getting more expensive and increased functionality goes hand in hand with higher cost. Next, during the actual running of telecare systems, successful operation has to compete with inherent difficulties of decision making in a noisy context. Making correct diagnoses is necessarily connected with false alarms, which may render the telecare system unusable. This is exacerbated by sources of unreliability in the system as a whole, like falling sensors, disconnected leads, empty batteries, and erased memories.In the light of these difficulties, traditional Technology Acceptance Models (TAMs) are focusing on a very small part and then probably the wrong one of the whole complex multistage decision process in implementing a telecare system.As it is, the comparatively immature state of telecare systems is up to now a multisectoral issue, in which stakeholders of different economic sectors operate mostly independently. Early stakeholders take decisions which later ones have to accept, up to the client as the end user, who also has to accept, but often does not. In a confusing situation like this, where the client is confronted with a system he or she has not chosen, it is doubtful that models based on a theory of rational behavior like the TAMs or Innovation Theory are valid at all.What should be minimally done on the basis of these observations are three things.First, an effective business case should be developed to run a telecare system – currently absent. Second, in addition to regulation, there should be a strong effort in the area of standardization. Finally, telecare should become a product that older people want, not one they have to accept.',\n",

       "  {'abstract': 'AbstractTo support the growing number of community-dwelling persons with dementia, alternative solutions, such as assistive technologies, are needed. In the European Rosetta Project, three separate ICT systems were improved, integrated, and evaluated with the objective to create one modular system that helps community-dwelling people with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia in different stages of the disease to retain their autonomy and quality of life that postpones institutional care and that supports the carers.The Rosetta system integrates the systems Elderly Day Navigator (EDN), Early Detection System (EDS), and Unattended Autonomous Surveillance–Advanced Awareness and Prevention System (UAS-AAPS). EDN supports persons in daily functioning in the areas of memory, social contact, daily activities, and safety; EDS monitors daily behavior and timely detects changes in functioning; and UAS-AAPS automatically detects emergency situations (like falls) and generates alarms to carers.The development of the system took place in close cooperation with persons with severe cognitive impairments/dementia, informal and professional carers, and dementia experts. The final prototype was tested in a controlled field trial with persons with severe cognitive impairments or dementia in three countries.The results from the evaluation study show that participants positively valued the usefulness of the system, but that the user-friendliness could be improved. Though there were no statistically significant effects on outcome measures in this explorative small-scale trial, participants indicated that the Rosetta system changed their lives in some ways, for instance, by structuring the day and by improving feelings of safety and security. Participants had no ethical concerns regarding the (visibility and application of) sensors and cameras.Future implementation of the Rosetta system may (cost-)effectively support the growing number of community-dwelling persons with dementia during the mild and more severe stages of the disease.',\n",

In addition, the integration of these models into a general evaluation and management framework is introduced.

Initially, this chapter presents the current problems of an aging population and a series of gaming trends, game genres, and technology used by older adults are described. This chapter further ascertains previous works, primarily reviews (narrative and systematic), to establish the current stance of utilizing digital games for health among older adults and assesses quality-of-life benefits. Aggregated recommendations across all the reviewed studies are listed and a comprehensive standard digital health game classification system is proposed. Games for health taxonomy and respective technologies are described, in particular the nature of engagement by users. Finally, recommendations for future research on games for health in the home are provided.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'AbstractFor care professionals, the main drive and, related to that, their job satisfaction, is based on being able to satisfy the needs of those who receive their care. Furthermore, most professionals working in contexts in which chronic care is provided, value inter-collegial respect and appreciation of supervisors. Therefore, success and failure factors of implementation of technology in health-care situations are associated with the disruption or support of these values. Mostly, health-care professionals do not themselves think about technological solutions for clinical problems, and therefore, they need support in relating technological solutions to care recipients’ needs. In this chapter, a short overview of professional values is given. Next, we outline how technology can be seen as disrupting professional values but also how it can be supportive of professional values, sometimes unexpected, as practice examples show. The chapter is concluded by consequences for daily practice and education in health-care professions.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'AbstractInulin-type fructans are prebiotic dietary fibers, naturally occurring in numerous plants. The chicory root with its high content of inulin-type fructans is the most common basis for gaining inulin from the plant. The process applied is a hot water extraction. This means, contrary to a number of commercially available dietary fibers, inulin is not synthesized but occurs naturally and was eaten by mankind 100,000 years ago. The colon, the main place of action of inulin-type fructans, is a highly active metabolic organ, containing an excessively complex collection of microbes. Inulin-type fructans are nondigestible in the small intestine and fermented in the large intestine, resulting in modifications in the colonic microbiota composition, towards a healthier pattern, and in the production of several metabolites. Thereby, they are among the very few scientifically proven prebiotics. Several health effects are related to this activity in the colon. They may range from local effects, starting with improvement of bowel movement, effects related to local immunity, to more systemic benefits for the body, as a result of the metabolic events, like weight and blood sugar management and bone health. This book chapter aims at providing a comprehensive review of the physiology related to inulin-type fructans and the health benefits related to this. Current developments in understanding the role of the microbiota in health and disease will probably also further contribute to understanding these complex influences originating from the gut and the role “colonic nutrients” such as prebiotic dietary fibers may play therein.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'AbstractOne of the most fascinating trends of the twenty-first century is the fact that most of us will live a long and mostly healthy and active life. Since 1840, life expectancy in the world has increased by an extra 3 months per year, a linear trend that has not reached its maximum. This trend is seen worldwide: both the increasing proportion of older people and the individual increase in duration are offering us several challenges and opportunities. Aging, especially the years of very old age, poses key questions as to how to manage health care, well-being, social engagement, dependency, and disability. In many developed countries, there has been a tremendous rise in health-care costs, unfavorably influenced by this trend of aging.Technology can support opportunities and challenges resulting from this trend: with the help of technology, social connectedness can be preserved and also resources, skills, and health-care needs can be supplied.In this chapter, an overview of recent demographic (and other) trends and the underlying causes of these trends and their relationship with accompanying technological developments is given.',\n",

The goal of TigerPlace was to develop a true aging in place housing site in which residents move into independent apartments and stay through the end of life. In-home sensing technology is used to augment care coordination to detect early signs of illness and functional decline to allow early interventions aimed at proactively keeping residents healthy. Over 55 apartments have been outfitted with in-home sensor networks since 2005 with an average longevity of 2.6 years. Sensors tested in TigerPlace apartments include motion sensors, bed sensors, stove temperature sensors, and gait/fall detection sensors. All sensors are environmentally mounted and designed to be as invisible as possible. Studies have investigated which sensors and sensor features are most important for detecting early illness signs. A prospective research study at TigerPlace using in-home sensing and automated health alerts showed significant differences in health outcomes between a control group receiving normal care and an intervention group with sensors and automated health alerts.',\n",

However, the difficulty in determining the magnitude and impacts of climate change has led to challenges in policy-making. This chapter seeks to create a comprehensive understanding of how Colombia and the federal government have made important advances in implementing a climate change framework with a focus on health.This chapter will provide context on the role and responsibilities of the government before discussing the climatic conditions of Colombia and how climate change is impacting the country, especially on the health sector. Such discussion will justify why climate change is a major current and future priority for the country. The chapter will then examine the existing climate change policy framework and ongoing projects that are targeted toward climate and health. This chapter will show that there is still a need to improve the capacities and interest of the public health research community by improving the evidence and knowledge about climate change impacts, vulnerability, and risk. Understanding Colombia’s national circumstances will allow other countries and decision-makers to potentially use Colombia as an example to define their own health and climate change agendas.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'AbstractIn much of the world today, populations are richer, taller, and enjoy longer healthier lives than their counterparts in the past. Cliometricians debate the extent to which this “health transition” was the result of nutritional improvements or other factors, such as the increase in public health infrastructure that followed mastery of the germ theory of disease. Although the long-run trend in health was positive, in the nineteenth century, many Western countries experienced cyclical downturns in the biological standard of living, the so-called antebellum puzzle. While the long-run trends in the growth of real GDP, income, and wages were positive, as the presence of the antebellum puzzle suggests, the onset of industrialization was accompanied by an increase in inequality, the stagnation of the expectation of life at birth, increases in morbidity, declines in mean adult stature, and an erosion in the consumption of net nutrients. Taken together, this experience has been labeled the “Malthusian squeeze.”',\n",

Under this aspect a general overview is given about the bioavailability of carbohydrates and their influence on dietary fiber intake and about the developing of the prebiotic concept and specific functional foods. Moreover, the occurrence and chemical composition of native dietary fiber such as resistant starch, pectin, hemicelluloses, ß-glucan, and fructan in context to their properties – in particular the prebiotic potential for human health – will be discussed. Important industrially produced bioactive carbohydrates from plant and seaweed sources with high prebiotic efficacy and increasing economic interest such as fructan – particularly inulin and fructooligosaccharides (FOS), heteropolysaccharides, xylooligosaccharides (XOS), and isomaltooligosaccharides (IMO) – will be presented. Additionally enzymatic processing of prebiotic-active oligosaccharides such as FOS, galactooligosaccharides (GOS), or nondigestible disaccharides such as isomaltulose and trehalulose derived from sucrose and lactose will be demonstrated and discussed.',\n",

The flow of these skills is forthcoming when the return to investment exceeds the cost (both direct and indirect). Returns to these skills are private in the sense that an individual’s productive capacity increases with more of them. But there are often externalities that increase the productive capacity of others when human capital is increased. This essay discusses these concepts historically and focuses on two major components of human capital: education and training, and health. The institutions that encourage human capital investment are discussed, as is the role of human capital in economic growth. The notion that the study of human capital is inherently historical is emphasized and defended.',\n",

Currently, a strong emphasis is being placed on the assessment of the costs associated with the health gains (expressed in quality-adjusted life years) that are achieved with these technologies. Following Hannah Arendt, we shall try to argue that such instrumental rationality is misplaced in discovering how technology can help to express human values. It typically reflects a society where processes of design and development, evaluation, and decision making involve separate trajectories and operate distinct from the realm of the lives of humans. We will present an alternative which is deliberative and transformative in nature. Its strengths and limitations will be explored, using the cochlear implant for deaf children as an example.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'AbstractThe combination of ubiquitous computing and wireless communication has provided the opportunities to create novel solutions to realize smart environment. The application of smart environments in the field of health care and assisted living is accelerating at a high pace. These systems can provide cost-effective solutions that will improve the quality of life of humans, particularly those regarded as senior citizens or have some form of disability. The realization of smart environments with real-time monitoring will enable such people to lead independent lives in the comfort of their normal homes. This chapter focuses on highlighting the major components and systems that are currently available to deliver reliable technological solutions for smart homes, health care, and well-being. The key sensing devices that form the basis of smart environments are discussed. The integration of these devices into wireless sensor networks (WSNs) that can be spread over an area to build smart health and assisted living environments is investigated. The role of power line communication technologies, which complements wireless communications, and the new reliable solutions is also highlighted. Wireless communication technologies and the various options and standards available are discussed. Target localization plays a key role in many of the services supported by smart environments. The various fundamental localization techniques are investigated. The major security and privacy issues related to WSNs and wearable body area networks (WBANs) and their impact on the trust in using such systems are addressed. A case study that demonstrates the integration of various WSNs elements to deploy a guiding system for blind persons is described.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'AbstractAn introduction and overview is provided of the radiation health challenges associated with extended human missions into deep space with the understanding that this is a complex endeavor presently under active research and development. Hence, this chapter necessarily reflects present limitations and the need for research to make such exploration missions possible. An introduction to the space radiation environment is provided followed by a brief overview of the radiobiology. The remainder of the chapter is focused on human health concerns from radiation exposure during extended deep space missions. Although the challenges are many, the greatest radiation-related concern from a mission perspective would be an exceptionally large solar-energetic-particle (SEP) event. Such an event, should it occur during extravehicular activity (EVA), or while in a spaceship insufficiently shielded, could potentially result in acute radiation sickness. Fortunately, radiation from SEP events can be shielded and therefore should be manageable through a combination of shielding design and early warning systems. In contrast, the ever-present chronic exposure to galactic cosmic radiation (GCR) is difficult to shield and will likely have to be accepted at some level. Although GCR produces a much lower dose rate than a large SEP event, there are significant uncertainties concerning the effects from the high-charge, high-energy (HZE) component of GCR. It has been estimated that GCR radiation may induce a significant lifetime cancer risk. It is less clear whether health effects such as cardiovascular or central nervous system problems will result from protracted GCR exposure. It is hoped that these and many other uncertainties will be reduced through research and development prior to sending humans to Mars.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'AbstractThis article concerns the preventive effects of medical liability. On theoretical grounds it is argued that medical liability does not necessarily lead to a socially optimal level of precaution, because the incentives are distorted in various ways. Since the 1970’s US states have enacted a variety of reforms in their tort systems. This variation has provided highly useful data for empirical studies of medical liability issues. For one thing, it has become clear that only some 2% of the patients with negligent injuries gets compensation. The empirical evidence nevertheless suggests that medical liability pressure does affect the behavior of health care providers to some degree. It has a negative effect on the supply of services, and it encourages the ordering of extra diagnostic tests. At the margin, medical liability law does seem to have some social benefits that offset reasonable estimates of overhead and defensive medicine costs.',\n",

The maturity of information and communication technology on the one hand and of medical technology on the other basically allows technology to take over the monitoring and care. However, so far, the inclusion of human factors and technology acceptance into a successful technology design is not adequately met. In the following, we describe relevant facets of technology empowerment and stigmas and the need to rethink traditional concepts. First, the requirements of adequate use and design of information and communication technologies in the medical field are addressed. Second, as the prevailing image of age is no longer adequate to the current demographic change, the need to rethink age and aging is described. Finally the need of user-centered design is discussed, followed by the need of a rethinking of the technology design process and the inclusion of potential users. The chapter ends with a discussion focused on requirements of patient empowerment to reflect all the aforementioned aspects from a patient’s point of view.',\n",

In recent years, there has been substantial progress in these areas. With technology advancement, there is the potential to facilitate aging in place, resulting in the continuation and maintenance of independent community-based living at varying stages of the life course. As technological developments improve, the concept of integrating digital game technology into the lives of an aging population is becoming more popular than ever before. However, during the implementation into the home, issues of physical space and technology integration may occur. There are many types of dwellings (apartments, houses, or bungalows) where older adults reside which contain a variety of fixtures and furnishings. Implementation of technology into these different dwellings may be difficult due to the added furniture already installed. This chapter initiates discussion within these areas and provides recommendations for future technology integration.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'AbstractAdaptation to climate change is increasingly supported through international financing. In contrast to mitigation, where the effectiveness of policy action can be measured through the metric “tonnes of CO2 equivalent reduced,” no universally accepted metric for assessment of adaptation effectiveness exists. Without such a metric, adaptation finance vehicles such as the Adaptation Fund or the Green Climate Fund encounter challenges when trying to compare the adaptive effect of projects in order to achieve an efficient allocation of their funds. First experiences with adaptation funding show a tendency to avoid final impact metrics. This might lead to a backlash against adaptation funding by electorates in industrialized countries if adaptation funding cannot show clear results. This report assesses two possible candidates for generic adaptation effectiveness metrics: (1) wealth saved from climate change impacts and (2) disability-adjusted life years saved (DALYs), which are widely used in public health policy analysis. Apart it is proposed to use no-harm assessments to evaluate environmental and cultural impacts of adaptation projects. The authors discuss uncertainties encountered in applying these metrics, including the uncertain link between commonly reported intermediate indicators and our metrics and ideas to handle such, e.g., the use of regularly updated methodologies and agreed climate and economic models.',\n",

Singapore’s total population is around 5.40 million (in 2013), with 4.6 % of its GDP spent on healthcare (in 2011) and an average life expectancy of 82.3 years for a newborn Singapore resident (in 2012). As a result of various drivers, a number of likely shifts and changes to Singapore’s healthcare system are foreseen. ICTs are regarded as potentially playing a significant role as enablers of the changes required. Singapore is ranked second highest out of 144 countries to leverage ICTs for improved competitiveness and well-being (in 2013). Notwithstanding this achievement, also for Singapore, a spectrum of critical challenges needs to be addressed for making transformative changes in healthcare. Three recent developments indicate Singapore’s strategy to strengthen its environment for the use of ICTs for health, including smart home technology.',\n",

Furthermore, these demographical changes put a large stress on the healthcare system. Therefore, adequate aging-in-place strategies become significantly important. Appropriate and comfortable housing is one of the key determinants to facilitate this desire. One of the aspects of concern is thermal comfort. Since the thermal requirements differ between young adults and the older counterparts, current models for assessing thermal comfort are not sufficiently accurate to be used for older adults. This chapter provides an overview of thermal comfort in relation to aging and the way smart home technologies including smart thermostats can contribute to well-being and health with respect to aging-in-place strategies.',\n",

For both its potential health benefits and functional properties, resistant starch has received much attention. It can positively influence the functioning of the digestive tract, the microbial flora, the blood cholesterol level, glycemic index and assist in the control of diabetes. Apart from the potential health benefits of resistant starch, another positive advantage is its lower impact on the sensory properties of food compared with traditional sources of fiber, as whole grains, bran, or other prebiotics. The low water-holding capacity, increased viscosity and gel formation and high water-binding capacity make it useful in a variety of foods. In this chapter, it was intended to discuss about different resistant starch types, food sources, potential health benefits and food applications of resistant starch.',\n",

This chapter explores the current status and lessons learned from smart home design and development worldwide to assess what designers and researchers perceive as facilitators and barriers to smart home adoption. A cross-sectional anonymous web survey assessing goals of projects, target audiences, team expertise, and barriers to translation to practice was conducted of smart home project or facility administrators and researchers identified through systematic search of scientific literature and online material. Response rate was 36.7 %. Fifteen usable surveys were included in the analysis. Findings indicate that several smart home projects exist with the aim of supporting communication and independent living. However, there are many challenges to their incorporation into the real world, including lack of funding support beyond the research phase, technology issues, and difficulty gaining widespread recognition as a valuable tool. Proper planning and design strategies are necessary to ensure the success and translation of such projects.',\n",

Many people agree that domotics are a highly promising development. They make life easier, can help the elderly continue living at home for a longer period of time, and can reduce the involvement of professional care providers and case managers, causing healthcare costs to go down. You’d expect to see massive growth in domotics applications. However, that is not the case as of yet, particularly not in extramural healthcare in the Netherlands (Nivel 2011). Applications in intramural institutions regularly involve infrared sensors, noise-level sensors, bed mats, door locks, cameras, speaker-microphone systems, alarm buttons, and chips in clothing. Figures on the amount of extramural application of domotics do not appear to be available in the Netherlands. Applications in the extramural setting appear to primarily involve the personal alarm button (RIVM National Institute for Public Health and the Environment 2013).',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'AbstractDespite the wide availability of telecare devices, the economic pressures, and the claimed benefits, the uptake of telecare services by older people is disappointingly limited. Much research is spent on finding out why the telecare acceptance is so much less than expected.Ease of use, or rather lack of it – a seemingly likely cause – is difficult to assess since the traditional usability criteria do not apply well to the daily life of older people. Acceptance in the social environment plays an important role, sometimes in a positive sense, but mostly in a negative one; however, social environment is all but impossible to manipulate.What does delay acceptance is the lack of standardization, which, in turn is also due to the fact that the impressive technological progress of the past decades has largely bypassed the field of assistive technology and health care. Another negative factor is cost. Though the price of devices has come down appreciably in recent years, system architecture and installation are getting more expensive and increased functionality goes hand in hand with higher cost. Next, during the actual running of telecare systems, successful operation has to compete with inherent difficulties of decision making in a noisy context. Making correct diagnoses is necessarily connected with false alarms, which may render the telecare system unusable. This is exacerbated by sources of unreliability in the system as a whole, like falling sensors, disconnected leads, empty batteries, and erased memories.In the light of these difficulties, traditional Technology Acceptance Models (TAMs) are focusing on a very small part and then probably the wrong one of the whole complex multistage decision process in implementing a telecare system.As it is, the comparatively immature state of telecare systems is up to now a multisectoral issue, in which stakeholders of different economic sectors operate mostly independently. Early stakeholders take decisions which later ones have to accept, up to the client as the end user, who also has to accept, but often does not. In a confusing situation like this, where the client is confronted with a system he or she has not chosen, it is doubtful that models based on a theory of rational behavior like the TAMs or Innovation Theory are valid at all.What should be minimally done on the basis of these observations are three things.First, an effective business case should be developed to run a telecare system – currently absent. Second, in addition to regulation, there should be a strong effort in the area of standardization. Finally, telecare should become a product that older people want, not one they have to accept.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'AbstractTo support the growing number of community-dwelling persons with dementia, alternative solutions, such as assistive technologies, are needed. In the European Rosetta Project, three separate ICT systems were improved, integrated, and evaluated with the objective to create one modular system that helps community-dwelling people with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia in different stages of the disease to retain their autonomy and quality of life that postpones institutional care and that supports the carers.The Rosetta system integrates the systems Elderly Day Navigator (EDN), Early Detection System (EDS), and Unattended Autonomous Surveillance–Advanced Awareness and Prevention System (UAS-AAPS). EDN supports persons in daily functioning in the areas of memory, social contact, daily activities, and safety; EDS monitors daily behavior and timely detects changes in functioning; and UAS-AAPS automatically detects emergency situations (like falls) and generates alarms to carers.The development of the system took place in close cooperation with persons with severe cognitive impairments/dementia, informal and professional carers, and dementia experts. The final prototype was tested in a controlled field trial with persons with severe cognitive impairments or dementia in three countries.The results from the evaluation study show that participants positively valued the usefulness of the system, but that the user-friendliness could be improved. Though there were no statistically significant effects on outcome measures in this explorative small-scale trial, participants indicated that the Rosetta system changed their lives in some ways, for instance, by structuring the day and by improving feelings of safety and security. Participants had no ethical concerns regarding the (visibility and application of) sensors and cameras.Future implementation of the Rosetta system may (cost-)effectively support the growing number of community-dwelling persons with dementia during the mild and more severe stages of the disease.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'AbstractShip structures are subjected to various deteriorating mechanisms throughout their service life. This deterioration is highly uncertain and can adversely affect the performance and safety of the vessel, and if not addressed properly, catastrophic failures may occur. In this chapter, deteriorating mechanisms affecting ship structures and their prediction models under uncertainty are discussed. In addition, the integration of these models into a general evaluation and management framework is introduced. This integration can support the optimal decision-making process regarding future structural interventions and, eventually, may lead to safe and efficient service life extension. The role of structural health monitoring and nondestructive evaluation techniques in damage identification, assessment, and prediction is also discussed.',\n",
