       "[{'abstract': 'AbstractTransparent Computing (TC) is becoming a promising paradigm in network computing era. Although many researchers believe that TC model has a high requirement for the communication bandwidth, there is no research on the communication bandwidth boundary or resource allocation, which impedes the development of TC. This paper focuses on studying an efficient transparent computing resource allocation model in an economic view. First, under the quality of experiments (QoE) ensured, the utility function of clients and transparent computing providers (TCPs) is constructed. After that, the demand boundary of communication bandwidth is analyzed under the ideal transparent computing model. Based on the above analyses, a resource allocation scheme based on double-sided combinational auctions (DCA) is proposed so that the resource can be shared by both the service side and the client side with the welfare of the whole society being maximized. Afterward, the results scheduled in different experimental scenarios are given, which verifies the effectiveness of the proposed strategy. Overall, this work provides an effective resource allocation model for optimizing the performance of TC.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'AbstractNow, mobile devices play an increasingly important role in social networks by sharing information quickly, such as mobile phones and wearable health surveillance devices. Mobile social networks are vulnerable to spammers because of the fragile security policies of mobile operating systems. Especially, social networks on mobile devices face many difficulties in defending against spammers due to their low computing power, poor network quality and long response time. Since graph-based algorithms require huge computing power, machine-learning classifiers require very short response time, and existing PC-based research is not suitable for mobile devices, we need a lightweight and fast response method for mobile devices to detect spammers in mobile social networks. Regarded as the extension of cloud computing, fog computing puts the data, data processing and applications in the devices that are at the edge of the Internet (without storing all of them in the cloud), which leads to a better real-time performance, adapts to the wide geographical distribution and the high mobility of mobile devices. In this paper, we propose COLOR + , a method based on fog computing that performs most computations at terminal (mobile devices). It only uses the interaction between the account and its neighbors, which makes it easy to store and calculate a local graph on a mobile device. Each interaction value can be applied to any request. COLOR + detects spammers based on a threshold of the suspicion degree. We collect 50 million normal accounts and about 40,000 spammers from Twitter. Experiments show that the accuracy of COLOR + is about 85.95%, whose average time to detect an account is 0.01s. Therefore, COLOR + is an effective detection method that can be quickly applied.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'AbstractNear-infrared (NIR) light as noninvasive external stimuli to trigger on-demand drug release has attracted great attention in recent years. However, the current existing NIR-related drug delivery systems (DDSs) still have difficulty in controlling the release of the individual drug separately. In the present work, a dot array-like DDS was developed for accurately controlling the release of multiple drugs. Each dot had a drug core and an outer protective layer. The outer protective layer consisted of lauric acid (LA) and polylactic acid (PLA). LA is a kind of phase-change material (PCM) with melting point of 43.8\\xa0°C. When loaded with polypyrrole nanoparticles (PPy NPs) that acted as photothermal transducers, the outer protective layer became NIR light responsive and was able to convert light into heat to melt the LA. As a result, the drugs stored inside were released. By changing the PPy loading, NIR light power density, and mass ratio of LA to PLA, the drug release profile could be carefully controlled. Such a NIR-responsive DDS may find great potential applications in treating diseases that require long-term therapies using more than one drug.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'AbstractA novel resin-based spherical carbon material was successfully prepared by suspension polymerization of alkyl phenol and formaldehyde and steam activation in combination with surface modification by heat treatment with dry air for enhancing Hg0 adsorption. The analysis results demonstrate that the oxidation-modified activated carbon spheres possess better mercury removal performance than untreated sorbents, and the ACS-O300 obtained by oxidation modified at 300\\xa0°C is the optimal sorbent at the adsorption temperature range from 25 to 150\\xa0°C. The main reason is assigned to the increase of the oxygen functional groups of C=O and C(O)–O–C that play an important role as effective active sites for binding the Hg0, even though the C(O)–O–C predominates in mercury removal performance under higher adsorption temperature. The optimum O2 concentration is 4\\xa0vol% at the O2 concentration range from 0 to 8\\xa0vol%. SO2 and NO are favorable to the mercury adsorption under 4\\xa0vol% O2, while H2O leads to the inhibition of the mercury adsorption. The TPD results suggest that a strong desorption peak at temperature around 235\\xa0°C and a weak peak at 324\\xa0°C should generate from mercury desorption of C\\u2009=\\u2009O and C(O)–O–C, correspondingly. Moreover, the XPS analysis results of the fresh and used sorbent indicates that the C=O and C(O)–O–C serve as strong oxidizer and facilitate electron transfer for converting Hg0 to Hg2+ in the chemisorption process. These results suggest that the obtained resin-based spherical porous carbon (ACS-O300) is promising for Hg0 capture.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'AbstractA Co–Mn/Ni foam catalyst and alkali metal K-poisoned catalyst were prepared by an impregnation method using foamed Ni metal as a carrier. Mn was the active component, and Co was a trace auxiliary. The effects of different levels of alkali metal K poisoning and different concentrations of Co auxiliaries on the K poisoning resistance of the catalyst were studied. The results showed that the number of Brønsted acid sites on the surface of the catalyst, the reduction capacity and the number of unsaturated Ni atoms decreased after the addition of K. The interaction between the active Mn and the metallic Ni decreased, and the activity of the catalyst decreased. As the addition amount of added K increased, the catalyst alkali metal poisoning phenomenon became more significant. The kinetic studies showed that the activation energy increased after the addition of K, whereas the activation energy of K0.3Co0.5/Fresh catalyst decreased after Co modification. The amounts of Brønsted acid and Lewis acid sites on the surface of the K-poisoned catalyst were improved dramatically by Co modification of the Mn/Ni foam catalyst. K destroys the extremely important Brønsted acid sites that adsorb and activate NH3, reducing the performance to less than half. Additionally, NH3-TPD and in situ DRIFT analyses showed that Co, K, Mn and Ni synergistically improved the acid sites. The number of Brønsted acid sites and Lewis acid sites on the catalyst surface were greatly increased in the K0.3Co0.5/Fresh catalyst, whose reduction performance increased substantially compared with the K0.3/Fresh catalyst.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'AbstractElevated amount of CO levels in the atmosphere poses serious health and environmental hazards. Oxidation of CO using suitable catalysts is one of the methods to control it. By means of DFT calculations, single Cu atom doped in S vacancy of MoS2 nanosheet is studied for CO oxidation catalysis. Cu atom is strongly confined at the S-defective site of the MoS2 sheet, possessing high energy barrier for the diffusion to its neighboring sites. Adsorption energy, charge transfer and orbital hybridization of CO and O2 molecules adsorbed Cu-doped MoS2 sheet reveal that O2 is relatively more strongly adsorbed than CO. High adsorption energy of O2 (−\\u20092.115\\xa0eV) and large charge transfer between O2 and Cu–MoS2 sheet (0.493e), compared to CO, make O2 adsorption more favorable, which extenuates CO poisoning and hence helps in the efficient CO oxidation process. The complete oxidation of CO takes place in two steps: $$ {\\\\text{CO}} + {\\\\text{O}}_{2} \\\\to {\\\\text{OOCO}} $$CO+O2→OOCO with activation energy of 0.201\\xa0eV, succeeded by $$ {\\\\text{OOCO}} + {\\\\text{CO}} \\\\to 2{\\\\text{CO}}_{2} $$OOCO+CO→2CO2 without any energy barrier. Our results show that the basal plane of MoS2 sheet gets activated by embedding it with Cu metal, which can catalyze CO oxidation reaction effectively and without poisoning issues. The high activity, stability and low cost features can possibly encourage fabricating MoS2-based catalysts for CO oxidation reaction.',\n",

On request from public health agencies, health plans and telephone triage services provide additional information regarding individuals who are part of apparent clusters of illness. This reporting framework has several advantages, including less sharing of protected health information, less risk that confidential information will be distributed inappropriately, the prospect of better public acceptance, greater acceptance by health plans, and less effort and cost for both health plans and public health agencies.

Here, we use historical eruption data to estimate a plausible range of ash-settling rates and ash particle characteristics for Auckland city, New Zealand. We propose and implement a new experimental set-up in controlled laboratory conditions, which incorporates a dual-pass transmissometer and solid aerosol generator, to reproduce these ash-settling rates and calculate visual ranges through the associated airborne volcanic ash. Our findings demonstrate that visibility is most impaired for high ash-settling rates (i.e.\\xa0>\\xa0500\\xa0g\\xa0m−2\\xa0h−1) and particle size is deemed the most influential ash characteristic for visual range. For the samples tested (all\\xa0<\\xa0320\\xa0μm particle diameter), visibility was restricted to\\xa0~\\xa01–2\\xa0m when ash settling was replicated for very high rates (i.e.\\xa0~\\xa04000\\xa0g\\xa0m−2\\xa0h−1) and was especially low when ash particles were fine-grained, more irregular in shape and lighter in colour. Finally, we consider potential implications for disruption to surface transportation in Auckland through comparisons with existing research which investigates the consequences of visual range reduction for other atmospheric hazards such as fog. This includes discussing how our approach might be utilised in emergency and transport management planning. Finally, we summarise strategies available for the mitigation of visibility degradation in environments contaminated with volcanic ash.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'AbstractA machine learning (ML)-based text classification system has several classifiers. The performance evaluation (PE) of the ML system is typically driven by the training data size and the partition protocols used. Such systems lead to low accuracy because the text classification systems lack the ability to model the input text data in terms of noise characteristics. This research study proposes a concept of misrepresentation ratio (MRR) on input healthcare text data and models the PE criteria for validating the hypothesis. Further, such a novel system provides a platform to amalgamate several attributes of the ML system such as: data size, classifier type, partitioning protocol and percentage MRR. Our comprehensive data analysis consisted of five types of text data sets (TwitterA, WebKB4, Disease, Reuters (R8), and SMS); five kinds of classifiers (support vector machine with linear kernel (SVM-L), MLP-based neural network, AdaBoost, stochastic gradient descent and decision tree); and five types of training protocols (K2, K4, K5, K10 and JK). Using the decreasing order of MRR, our ML system demonstrates the mean classification accuracies as: 70.13\\u2009±\\u20090.15%, 87.34\\u2009±\\u20090.06%, 93.73\\u2009±\\u20090.03%, 94.45\\u2009±\\u20090.03% and 97.83\\u2009±\\u20090.01%, respectively, using all the classifiers and protocols. The corresponding AUC is 0.98 for SMS data using Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) based neural network. All the classifiers, the best accuracy of 91.84\\u2009±\\u20090.04% is shown to be of MLP-based neural network and this is 6% better over previously published. Further we observed that as MRR decreases, the system robustness increases and validated by standard deviations. The overall text system accuracy using all data types, classifiers, protocols is 89%, thereby showing the entire ML system to be novel, robust and unique. The system is also tested for stability and reliability.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'AbstractInfectious disease outbreaks often have consequences beyond human health, including concern among the population, economic instability, and sometimes violence. A warning system capable of anticipating social disruptions resulting from disease outbreaks is urgently needed to help decision makers prepare appropriately. We designed a system that operates in near real-time to identify and predict social response. Over 150,000 Internet-based news articles related to outbreaks of 16 diseases in 72 countries and territories were provided by HealthMap. These articles were automatically tagged with indicators of the disease activity and population reaction. An anomaly detection algorithm was implemented on the population reaction indicators to identify periods of unusually severe social response. Then a model was developed to predict the probability of these periods of unusually severe social response occurring in the coming week, 2 and 3\\xa0weeks. This model exhibited remarkably strong performance for diseases with substantial media coverage. For country-disease pairs with a median of 20 or more articles per year, the onset of social response in the next week was correctly predicted over 60% of the time, and 87% of weeks were correctly predicted. Performance was weaker for diseases with little media coverage, and, for these diseases, the main utility of our system is in identifying social response when it occurs, rather than predicting when it will happen in the future. Overall, the developed near real-time prediction approach is a promising step toward developing predictive models to inform responders of the likely social consequences of disease spread.',\n",

Detecting anomalous mobility patterns in a city needs to take spatial, temporal, and traffic information into consideration. Although existing techniques are able to extract spatiotemporal features for anomaly analysis, few systematic analysis about how different factors contribute to or affect the anomalous patterns has been proposed. In this paper, we propose a novel technique to localize spatiotemporal anomalous events based on tensor decomposition. The proposed method employs a spatial-feature-temporal tensor model and analyzes latent mobility patterns through unsupervised learning. We first train the model based on historical data and then use the model to capture the anomalies, i.e., the mobility patterns that are significantly different from the normal patterns. The proposed technique is evaluated based on the yellow-cab dataset collected from New York City. The results show several interesting latent mobility patterns and traffic anomalies that can be deemed as anomalous events in the city, suggesting the effectiveness of the proposed anomaly detection method.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'AbstractBackgroundThe current understanding of the landscape epidemiology of Ross River virus (RRV), Australia’s most common arthropod-borne pathogen, is fragmented due to gaps in surveillance programs and the relatively narrow focus of the research conducted to date. This leaves public health agencies with an incomplete understanding of the spectrum of infection risk across the diverse geography of the Australian continent. The current investigation sought to assess the risk of RRV epidemics based on abiotic and biotic landscape features in anthropogenic landscapes, with a particular focus on the influence of water and wildlife hosts.MethodsAbiotic features, including hydrology, land cover and altitude, and biotic features, including the distribution of wild mammalian hosts, were interrogated using a Maxent model to discern the landscape suitability to RRV epidemics in anthropogenically impacted environments across Australia.ResultsWater-soil balance, proximity to controlled water reservoirs, and the ecological niches of four species (Perameles nasuta, Wallabia bicolor, Pseudomys novaehollandiae and Trichosurus vulpecula) were important features identifying high risk landscapes suitable for the occurrence of RRV epidemics.ConclusionsThese results help to delineate human infection risk and thus provide an important perspective for geographically targeted vector, wildlife, and syndromic surveillance within and across the boundaries of local health authorities. Importantly, our analysis highlights the importance of the hydrology, and the potential role of mammalian host species in shaping RRV epidemic risk in peri-urban space. This study offers novel insight into wildlife hosts and RRV infection ecology and identifies those species that may be beneficial to future targeted field surveillance particularly in ecosystems undergoing rapid change.',\n",

Affected communities look for known symptoms, prevention measures, and treatment strategies. On the other hand, health organizations try to get situational updates to assess the severity of the outbreak, known affected cases, and other details. Recent emergence of social media platforms such as Twitter provide convenient ways and fast access to disseminate and consume information to/from a wider audience. Research studies have shown potential of this online information to address information needs of concerned authorities during outbreaks, epidemics, and pandemics. In this work, we target three types of end-users (i) vulnerable population—people who are not yet affected and are looking for prevention related information (ii) affected population—people who are affected and looking for treatment related information, and (iii) health organizations—like WHO, who are interested in gaining situational awareness to make timely decisions. We use Twitter data from two recent outbreaks (Ebola and MERS) to build an automatic classification approach useful to categorize tweets into different disease related categories. Moreover, the classified messages are used to generate different kinds of summaries useful for affected and vulnerable communities as well as health organizations. Results obtained from extensive experimentation show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'AbstractBackgroundRefugees may have an increased vulnerability to infectious diseases, and the consequences of an outbreak are more severe in a refugee camp. When an outbreak is suspected, access to clinical information is critical for investigators to verify that an outbreak is occurring, to determine the cause and to select interventions to control it. Experience from previous outbreaks suggests that the accuracy and completeness of this information is poor. This study is the first to assess the adequacy of clinical characterisation of acute medical illnesses in refugee camps. The objective is to direct improvements in outbreak identification and management in this vulnerable setting.MethodsWe collected prospective data in 13 refugee camps in Greece. We passively observed consultations where patients presented with syndromes that might warrant inclusion into an existing syndromic surveillance system and then undertook a structured assessment of routine clinical data collection to examine the extent to which key clinical parameters required for an outbreak response were ascertained and then documented.ResultsA total of 528 patient consultations were included. The most common presenting condition was an acute respiratory illness. Clinicians often made a comprehensive clinical assessment, especially for common syndromes of respiratory and gastrointestinal conditions, but documented their findings less frequently. For fewer than 5% of patients were a full set of vital signs ascertained and so the severity of patient illnesses was largely unknown. In only 11% of consultations was it verified that a patient who met the case criteria for syndromic surveillance reporting based on an independent assessment was reported into the system.DiscussionOpportunities exist to strengthen clinical data capture and recording in refugee camps, which will produce a better calibrated and directed public health response.ConclusionInformation of significant utility for outbreak response is collected at the clinical interface and we recommend improving how this information is recorded and linked into surveillance systems.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'AbstractPurpose of ReviewWe present a review of the likely consequences of climate change for foodborne pathogens and associated human illness in higher-income countries.Recent FindingsThe relationships between climate and food are complex and hence the impacts of climate change uncertain. This makes it difficult to know which foodborne pathogens will be most affected, what the specific effects will be, and on what timescales changes might occur. Hence, a focus upon current capacity and adaptation potential against foodborne pathogens is essential. We highlight a number of developments that may enhance preparedness for climate change. These include the following:Adoption of novel surveillance methods, such as syndromic methods, to speed up detection and increase the fidelity of intervention in foodborne outbreaksGenotype-based approaches to surveillance of food pathogens to enhance spatiotemporal resolution in tracing and tracking of illnessEver increasing integration of plant, animal and human surveillance systems, One Health, to maximise potential for identifying threatsIncreased commitment to cross-border (global) information initiatives (including big data)Improved clarity regarding the governance of complex societal issues such as the conflict between food safety and food wasteStrong user-centric (social) communications strategies to engage diverse stakeholder groupsSummaryThe impact of climate change upon foodborne pathogens and associated illness is uncertain. This emphasises the need to enhance current capacity and adaptation potential against foodborne illness. A range of developments are explored in this paper to enhance preparedness.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'AbstractBackgroundThere is increasing focus on the strength of primary health care systems in low and middle-income countries (LMIC). There are important roles for higher quality district hospital care within these systems. These hospitals are also sources of information of considerable importance to health systems, but this role, as with the wider roles of district hospitals, has been neglected.Key messagesAs we make efforts to develop higher quality health systems in LMIC we highlight the critical importance of district hospitals focusing here on how data on hospital mortality offers value: i) in understanding disease burden; ii) as part of surveillance and impact monitoring; iii) as an entry point to exploring system failures; and iv) as a lens to examine variability in health system performance and possibly as a measure of health system quality in its own right. However, attention needs paying to improving data quality by addressing reporting gaps and cause of death reporting. Ideally enabling the collection of basic, standardised patient level data might support at least simple case-mix and case-severity adjustment helping us understand variation. Better mortality data could support impact evaluation, benchmarking, exploration of links between health system inputs and outcomes and critical scrutiny of geographic variation in quality and outcomes of care. Improved hospital information is a neglected but broadly valuable public good.ConclusionAccurate, complete and timely hospital mortality reporting is a key attribute of a functioning health system. It can support countries’ efforts to transition to higher quality health systems in LMIC enabling national and local advocacy, accountability and action.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'AbstractMultiple data sources are essential to provide reliable information regarding the emergence of potential health threats, compared to single source methods. Spatial Scan Statistics have been adapted to analyze multivariate data sources, but only ad hoc procedures have been devised to address the problem of selecting the most likely cluster and computing its significance. In this work, information from multiple data sources of disease surveillance is incorporated to achieve more coherent spatial cluster detection using tools from multi-criteria analysis. The best cluster solutions are found by maximizing two objective functions simultaneously, based on the concept of dominance. To evaluate the statistical significance of solutions, a statistical approach based on the concept of attainment function is used. The multi-criteria approach has several advantages: the representation of the evaluation function for each data source is clear, and does not suffer from an artificial, and possibly confusing mixture with the other data source evaluations; it is possible to attribute, in a rigorous way, the statistical significance of each candidate cluster; and it is possible to analyze and pick-up the best cluster solutions, as given naturally by the non-dominated set. The methodology is illustrated with real datasets.',\n",
