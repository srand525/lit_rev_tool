Presently, there is no cure for BCRL. The single greatest risk factor for developing BCRL is an axillary lymph node dissection (ALND). Lymphatic Microsurgical Preventative Healing Approach (LYMPHA) is a surgical procedure to reduce the risk of lymphedema in patients undergoing an ALND. We present our single institution results after offering LYMPHA in the context of an established lymphedema surveillance program.",The Journal of surgical research,2018,2/6/181,10.1016/j.vaccine.2018.01.071,Detection of rotavirus before and after monovalent rotavirus vaccine introduction and vaccine effectiveness among children in mainland Tanzania.,"Monovalent rotavirus vaccine (RV1) was introduced in Tanzania in January 2013 under the Reach Every Child initiative, to be given at ages 6 and 10â€¯weeks.

Following the end of the separatist war in Sri Lanka in 2009, the Anti Malaria Campaign (AMC) of Sri Lanka intensified malaria surveillance jointly with a private sector partner, Tropical and Environmental Diseases and Health Associates Private Limited (TEDHA) with a view to achieving malaria elimination targets by 2014.",BMC health services research,2018,3/24/189,10.1186/s12916-018-1015-9,Clinical assessment is a neglected component of outbreak preparedness: evidence from refugee camps in Greece.,"Refugees may have an increased vulnerability to infectious diseases, and the consequences of an outbreak are more severe in a refugee camp. When an outbreak is suspected, access to clinical information is critical for investigators to verify that an outbreak is occurring, to determine the cause and to select interventions to control it.
