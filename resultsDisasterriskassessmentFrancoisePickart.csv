0,Francoise Pickart,10.1002/14651858.CD002097.pub4,Primary care professionals providing non-urgent care in hospital emergency departments.,"In many countries emergency departments (EDs) are facing an increase in demand for services, long waits, and severe crowding. One response to mitigate overcrowding has been to provide primary care services alongside or within hospital EDs for patients with non-urgent problems. However, it is unknown how this impacts the quality of patient care and the utilisation of hospital resources, or if it is cost-effective. This is the first update of the original Cochrane Review published in 2012.",The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,2018,2018-02-14

On the other hand, hypothermia associates with increased mortality and organ failure in patients with sepsis. This study aimed to assess the predictive validity of qSOFA for identifying patients with sepsis at higher risk of multiple organ dysfunction or death and the complementary effect of hypothermia.",Journal of intensive care medicine,2018,2018-03-17
